# C5-Planner-KC

## Description

This Challenge's purpose was to utilize JQuery to add function to the starter code. The function added was the ability to utilize local storage to save changes to the Work Day Scheduler. While also allowing the colors of the text boxes to change as the day progresses through the associated times. This challenge allowed me to dig into JQuery and see how it can make the coding process easier.
